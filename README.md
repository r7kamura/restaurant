## Auto-defined application
Models, controllers, and routes are auto-defined from your config/restaurant.yml.

```yaml
# config/restaurant.yml
v1:               # Namespaced by v1
  public:         # User with "public" scope token
    recipes:      #
      actions:    #
        - show    # can access to /recipes/:id
      attributes: #
        - title   # can read recipe.title
  admin:          # User with "admin" scope token
    recipes:      #
      actions:    #
        - index   # can access to /recipes
        - show    # can access to /recipes/:id
      where:      #
        - id      # can filter recipes by id
        - title   # can filter recipes by title
      order:      #
        - id      # can sort recipes by id
        - title   # can sort recipes by title
      attributes: #
        - id      # can read recipe.id
        - title   # can read recipe.title
```

## SQL-like URI query
You can filter and sort resources by SQL-like URI query.

```ruby
context "with where params" do
  it "returns recipes filtered by given query" do
    get "/v1/recipes", { where: { title: { eq: recipe.title } } }, env
    response.should be_ok
    response.body.should be_json(
       "id"         => 1,
       "user_id"    => 1
       "body"       => "body 1",
       "title"      => "title 1",
       "updated_at" => "2000-01-01T00:00:00Z",
       "created_at" => "2000-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    )
  end
end
```
